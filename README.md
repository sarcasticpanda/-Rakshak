# 🏃‍♂️ Stampede Detection System

## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based system for detecting potential stampede situations in crowded environments. It leverages YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and BoT-SORT for multi-object tracking. The system can analyze both live and recorded video feeds to identify crowd density and movement anomalies that may indicate a stampede risk.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time crowd detection using YOLOv8
- Multi-object tracking with BoT-SORT
- Analysis of crowd movement patterns
- Low-light enhancement using CLAHE and Zero-DCE
- Alert system for potential stampede situations

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (for object detection)
- BoT-SORT (for tracking)
- CLAHE, Zero-DCE (for low-light enhancement)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data analysis)
